Hi! I'm Mayumi (she/her). Thanks for visiting my website.

I'm a freelance frontend developer. Feel free to comment on my posts or contact me!

What I'm passionate about besides web, are traveling, languages and watching sumo. I'm always a lonely planet backpacker, and have been to over 20 countries.

- Gatsby + WordPress

A blog run by a friend of mine (Japanese only). Using WordPress as a headless CMS. It'easy to edit because the editor is Gutenberg. \* However, all Gutenberg/theme functions can't work as you can imagine.

The design is almost full adapted from WordPress repository theme [Arkhe](https://arkhe-theme.com/). \* Update on WordPress side doesn't work at Gatsby side of course.
